The four ITR topics I chose are:
1. frequent itemset mining (Week 1)
2. principal component analysis and K-means clustering (Week 3)
3. singular value decomposition (Week 4)
4. interrupted time series analysis (Week 7)

Dataset preparation:
1. frequent itemset mining: use a **[new dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olegfostenko/almost-a-million-spotify-tracks)**, which includes genre information.
2. principal component analysis and K-means clustering & 3. singular value decomposition: use the **[dataset as in workshop poster](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yamaerenay/spotify-dataset-19212020-600k-tracks)** , preprocessed through `preprocess.py`
4. interrupted time series analysis: based on the **PCA results**, preprocessed through `ITR-Principal Component Analysis KMeans.py`
